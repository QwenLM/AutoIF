Preprocess the data:\n   ```python\n   scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1))\n   scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data['Close'].values.reshape(-1, 1))\n   ```\n\n5. Prepare training data:\n   ```python\n   X_train, y_train = [], []\n   for i in range(60, len(scaled_data)):\n       X_train.append(scaled_data[i-60:i, 0])\n       y_train.append(scaled_data[i, 0])\n\n   X_train, y_train = np.array(X_train), np.array(y_train)\n   X_train = np.reshape(X_train, (X_train.shape[0], X_train.shape[1], 1))\n   ```\n\n6. Build the LSTM model:\n   ```python\n   model = Sequential()\n   model.add(LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], 1)))\n   model.add(LSTM(units=50))\n   model.add(Dense(1))\n\n   model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam')\n   ```\n\n7. Train the model:\n   ```python\n   model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=1, batch_size=1, verbose=2)\n   ```\n\n8. Make predictions:\n   ```python\n   test_data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2023-01-01', end='2023-02-01')\n   actual_prices = test_data['Close'].values\n   total_dataset = pd.concat((data['Close'], test_data['Close']), axis=0)\n\n   model_inputs = total_dataset[len(total_dataset) - len(test_data) - 60:].values\n   model_inputs = model_inputs.reshape(-1, 1)\n   model_inputs = scaler.transform(model_inputs)\n\n   X_test = []\n\n   for x in range(60, len(model_inputs)):\n       X_test.append(model_inputs[x - 60:x, 0])\n\n   X_test = np.array(X_test)\n   X_test = np.reshape(X_test, (X_test.shape[0], X_test.shape[1], 1))\n\n   predicted_prices = model.predict(X_test)\n   predicted_prices = scaler.inverse_transform(predicted_prices)\n   ```\n\nThis code provides a basic framework for predicting stock prices using an LSTM model with data fetched from Yahoo Finance. Adjustments may be needed based on your specific requirements or for better performance."]}
